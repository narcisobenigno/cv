## Areas Still Needing Attention

### HIGH PRIORITY

#### 1. Missing Metrics for Other Positions

**Slice Pay** (Current role - February 2025 - Present)
- Location: `src/metadata/metadata.js:37-41`
- Missing:
  - Team size
  - Timeline of Notion → Event Sourcing migration
  - Impact of the transformation (time saved, reliability improvements)
  - Stakeholder count for Event Storming workshops

**Pragmateam** (Dec 2018 - Aug 2020)
- Location: `src/metadata/metadata.js:91-93`
- Only 2 sentences for nearly 2-year consultancy role
- Missing:
  - Number of clients worked with
  - Types of projects delivered
  - Specific outcomes or improvements achieved
  - Team sizes or engagement durations

**Bionexo** (Jul 2017 - Sep 2018)
- Location: `src/metadata/metadata.js:107-109`
- Relatively short but could benefit from:
  - Team size
  - Specific legacy problems solved (quantified)
  - Migration scope or timeline

**ThoughtWorks** (Feb 2015 - Jun 2017)
- Location: `src/metadata/metadata.js:127-129`
- Only 1 sentence for 2+ years at prestigious consultancy
- Missing:
  - Number of client engagements
  - Industries or company types
  - Specific improvements delivered
  - Team sizes or project scopes

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 2. Additional Experience Section Structure

Location: `src/metadata/metadata.js:132-139`

**Current state:** Only one entry (Caelum teaching role) for an entire major section

**Options to consider:**
- **Add more experiences:** Open source contributions, conference talks, community involvement, technical writing
- **Fold into timeline:** Move the teaching experience into the main Professional Experience section chronologically (it would fit around 2014-2015 based on the timeline)
- **Remove entirely:** If no other experiences to add, consider removing to avoid drawing attention to a thin section

### LOW PRIORITY

#### 3. Minor Wording Refinements

**Slice Pay description** (line 38):
- "Led the transformation" - For a very early stage startup, clarify if this was solo work or collaborative
- Consider mentioning team size or if you're a founding engineer

**Education section** (template line 105):
- Could add graduation honors, relevant coursework, or thesis topic if applicable
- Could mention that CS degree contextualizes the "since 2007" interest in software

#### 4. Skills Tags Consistency

- Some positions use lowercase "golang" (ThoughtWorks:124) while opening uses "Golang"
- Pragmateam still lists "JavaScript" (line 88) instead of "TypeScript" - consider updating if TypeScript was actually used

## Recommendations Priority List

### Quick Wins (15-30 minutes)
1. Add 2-3 sentences with metrics to **Slice Pay** (team size, migration timeline, impact)
2. Expand **ThoughtWorks** description (1-2 client examples, specific improvements)
3. Expand **Pragmateam** description (client count, project types)
4. Fix "golang" → "Golang" consistency

### Medium Effort (30-60 minutes)
5. Add brief metrics to **Bionexo** (team size, quantified improvements)
6. Decide on **Additional Experience** section approach and implement

### Optional Enhancements
7. Add honors/details to Education section
8. Consider adding brief leadership mentions if applicable (mentoring, tech lead responsibilities)

## Overall Assessment

The resume has improved significantly from the initial review. The opening statement is now compelling and specific, and the Indebted section properly represents your longest tenure with concrete achievements and outcomes.

**Current strength:** Strong for senior IC (Individual Contributor) roles in event sourcing, fintech, and distributed systems

**Main weakness:** Other positions lack the detail and metrics needed to demonstrate consistent track record of impact

**Estimated improvement needed:** 30-60 minutes of work to add metrics and brief details to the other 4 positions would bring the resume to a very strong state.
