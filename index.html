      <p>Over 15 years of professional software development across startups, scale-ups, and consultancies have taken me through diverse environments and teams across Brazil and Australia. I've worked with Golang, Java, Ruby, TypeScript, and Kotlin in both on-premise and cloud environments (AWS, GCP), learning to adapt quickly to different organisational contexts and technical challenges.</p>

      <p>I can help organisations at any stage—early startups delivering and validating hypotheses with simple architectures, scale-ups modernizing architectures for sustainable growth while mitigating operational risk through frequent delivery and minimal disruption, or established companies strengthening team practices for sustainable delivery. This includes establishing DevOps practices with cloud infrastructure on AWS, expanding platforms internationally while balancing regulatory compliance with business delivery, and combining technical practices (TDD, Continuous Delivery, DDD) with collaborative approaches that enable teams to experiment, deliver incrementally, and maintain sustainable pace.</p>

      <p>Recently, I've been developing and researching with AI, exploring how it impacts team dynamics, flow, software architecture, and collaboration patterns. If your organisation needs hands-on help with event sourcing adoption, international platform expansion, or strengthening agile engineering practices, I bring proven experience from global platform transformations and legacy migrations.</p>

                <div><p>Joined as the first dedicated engineer after a temporary engineer validated product-market fit with a basic prototype (single API endpoint, Notion as database). My main responsibility was to improve sales by providing minimum features and assess the potential business and technical bottlenecks that were emerging.</p>

<p>The Notion-based system revealed critical bottlenecks: business processes built directly on top of Notion created deep coupling that required multiple iterations to decouple, poor technical and product observability, platform flakiness, and substantial manual operational overhead. Since Notion is not designed as a production database, removing this dependency was critical to avoid undermining the product&#39;s potential. After implementing initial features to enable sales, I led the re-architecture of the entire system. We facilitated Event Storming workshops involving product, operations, sales, and marketing teams to inform the design.</p>

<p>The migration strategy prioritized zero business disruption: deployed CQRS with event sourcing infrastructure from day one, initially emitting events in-memory while maintaining the existing API contract to avoid breaking client integrations. Once the flow was complete, activated event persistence and migrated historical Notion data to proper events, giving older bookings the same functionality as new ones.</p>

<p>This transformation achieved substantial reduction in manual operational and engineering work tracked by metrics, while enabling analytics capabilities through BigQuery projections that allowed teams to build dashboards and reports using low-code tools. All development maintained 24/7 availability with zero downtime throughout the transition.</p></div>

                <div><p>InDebted is a debt collection company that relies on data to provide a smarter and more sensible approach, supporting customers to get their financial life back on track.</p>

<p>During my period at InDebted, I was instrumental in the platform&#39;s globalisation efforts. First, expanding to Canada which required adapting the platform to meet Canadian regulatory requirements. Then leading the more complex expansion to the US market, ensuring compliance with US-specific debt collection regulations.</p>

<p>A key technical achievement was absorbing the legacy platform into the new CQRS and event sourcing architecture. This migration preserved complete audit trails for old accounts and maintained data integrity and history for existing clients, ensuring no data loss during the transition.</p>

<p>Working within a team of 10 engineers, I collaborated primarily through pair and mob programming to tackle complex challenges and leading many of those teams tackling strategic goals. When timezone differences between US and Australia made mobbing impractical, we maintained regular check-ins to ensure alignment. Combined with trunk-based development, this approach resulted in minimal rework, low bug rates, and eliminated time spent on code reviews.</p>

<p>Throughout this work, I maintained the platform&#39;s 24/7 availability with zero downtime. The architecture enabled continuous experimentation and real-time impact measurement while ensuring the team could progress independently with fast releases and simple extensibility. As well as changing and implementing features into the Indebted&#39;s frontend application using React.</p></div>
